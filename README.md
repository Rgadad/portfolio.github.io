### Parking slot management system  

OVERVIEW:  

A Parking Slot Management System is a software application designed to efficiently manage and monitor parking spaces in various environments, such as malls, offices, airports, or residential complexes. It simplifies the process of allocating, tracking, and optimizing parking slots for users, ensuring better utilization of resources and a smoother parking experience.

Technical Stack:  

- Languages: C++, Java  
- Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

Impact:  

- Efficient Space Utilization: Reduces unoccupied slots and optimizes layout.
- Reduced Waiting Time: Quick allocation and payment systems improve user satisfaction.
- Enhanced Revenue: Dynamic pricing and better occupancy lead to higher revenue.
- Eco-Friendly Solutions: Encourages EV parking and reduces unnecessary vehicle movement.
- Improved Security: Monitored and controlled parking environments ensure safety.
